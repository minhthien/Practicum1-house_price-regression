# Practicum1-house_price-regression
#Project summary

The purpose of this project is to build machine learning models such as random forest, gradient boosting and stack models of the two to predict the sale prices of a house. This project is from the kaggle competition. In this summary I will outline four things:

I.	Data source and data description

II.	Initial data exploratory

III.	Steps to clean data and select features

IV.	Build random forest, gradient boosting and stack model  


final report are in : final_report.docx

R code are in  :data_exploratory.R, clean_data.R, build_rf_model.R, build_XGboost_model.R, stack_model.R result_stack_model.csv


output file by R code:  selectedFeatureData.csv, result_final_rf_model.csv,  result_xgb_boost_model.csv , result_stack_model.csv
